# Homework 2

# Problem 0

# Problem 1
I recreated the Union 2.1 Compilation Type Ia supernova Hubble diagram (Figure 4 in [Suzuki et al 2012](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.3470v1.pdf)). The Bokeh app can be run with

`bokeh serve --show bokeh_hubble.py`

The checkboxes on the right allow the user to select which sub-sample to plot. The Hubble diagram (distance modulus as a function of redshift) is plotted for the selected data sets, and below that residuals from the best fit cosmology are shown. When no boxes are checked, all of the data is plotted.

# Problem 2
The recreated figure is `problem_2.png` and the code used to generate it is saved as `problem_2.py`

# Problem 3
The brushing code is in the Jupyter notebook `brushing.ipynb`
